#Interrupt Vectors

All interrupt vectors must have a prototype in `interrupts.h`. This is due to a quirk of the SDCC compiler.

> "If you have multiple source fles in your project,
> interrupt service routines can be present in any of them, but a 
> prototype of the isr MUST be present or included in the file that
> contains the function main."
